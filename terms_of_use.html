                supersedes, and the terms of this Agreement govern, all previous oral and written communications
                regarding these matters, all of which are merged into this Agreement. No employee, agent, or other
                representative of Notch has any authority to bind Notch with respect to any statement, representation,
                warranty, or other expression unless the same is specifically set forth in this Agreement. No usage of

                interpret, supplement, or alter the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement may be changed only by a
                written agreement signed by an authorized agent of the party against whom enforcement is sought. Notch
                will not be bound by, and specifically objects to, any term, condition, or other provision that is
                different from or in addition to this Agreement (whether or not it would materially alter this
                Agreement) that is proffered by Subscriber in any receipt, acceptance, confirmation, correspondence, or
                otherwise, unless Notch specifically agrees to such provision in writing and signed by an authorized
                agent of Notch.
